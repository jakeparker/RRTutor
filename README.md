A tutor for Matrix Row Reduction.

I have included two versions. A partial implementation of an cognitive tutor, written in Jess and HTML5, and a full implementation of an example tracing tutor, written in FLASH.

You can run the FLASH version, by simply drag "RRTutor.swf" to your browser (preferably Chrome).

The run the HTML5 version, you will need to host RRTutor on a server, and point your browser to it.

For example, you could start a MAMP server on port '8888', referencing 'RRTutor/HTML5/', and then point your browser to 'http://localhost:8888/RRTutor.html'.


To install the dependencies, open a terminal and run "bower install" or "npm update".

If you don't have bower installed, then just run "npm install -g bower".

Where "npm", is the Node.js package manager.
